        Hi, my name is Camelia and I am from Transilvania, Romania. When I was 7,
        I moved to Spain, somewhere close to Barcelona where I did most of my primary and secondary studies.
        I also did there a couple of years of college before transferring my studies to the United
        States. During my undergrad, I really enjoyed learning lots of programming even thought my
        major is Mathematics, and later on I also started being more involved in sports, such as
        squash and rock climbing. This Spring I graduated from the University of Maryland with a GPA
        of 3.69. This Summer, I am starting my graduate research in the [v]alt lab with Prof. Remco Chang.
