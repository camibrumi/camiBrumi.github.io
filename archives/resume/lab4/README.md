# Lab 4: My Portfolio
Please note that the project was stored in the /lab4 folder in the github.io special repo because I already had a github.io page.


## Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented and what have not

I believe that my html was correctly implemented:
- My html and css passed the the official HTML5 and CSS validation tests.
- I used one CSS file.
- I didn't use any styling element html and I defined them in the CSS file.
- I didn't use any styling attribute in elements.
- I used a relative URL for my image.
- I didn't use any front-end framework for this lab.
- I used my own, created-from-scratch CSS file.
- I used HTML and CSS only for the purposes of this project.
- I stored this project in my github.io repo.

I think I should have used more than one CSS file, one for each html file.
I believe this is why I could not perfectly center the link items and the image in the index file.

Another think I would have done is that I would have used an absolute URL to an external website to fetch my photo, but
the assignment indicated to use a relative URL, which means that I can only fetch my image from my repo.
For security reasons, by uploading images to git, they will still not be displayed if the web page is accessed by using the link [kamibrumi.github.io/lab4/index.html](kamibrumi.github.io/lab4/index.html).

## Whom I have collaborated or discussed the lab
~ No one.

## approximately how many hours I have spent completing the lab
4-5 hours.
