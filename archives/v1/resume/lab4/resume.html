                <h3>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h3>
                <h4>GVIL Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, MD</h4>
                <p>Researched on how to obtain an animation from a single image,
                    e.g. a landscape with a lake, mountains and clouds. We could animate just the water and clouds
                    from the image in the example above
                    without altering the other objects. I worked with
                    <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/" target="_blank">Prof. Amitabh Varshney</a>
                    and his Ph.D. student

                    During Fall 2019 I worked on a warm-up project about foveated 360ยบ video
                    streaming with a focus on sampling methods to reduce the required bandwidth between
                    server and a client.
