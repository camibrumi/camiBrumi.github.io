                <p>Currently researching on how to obtain an animation from a single image,
                    e.g. a landscape with a lake, mountains and clouds. I am researching how
                    to animate just the water and clouds from the image in the example above,
                    without altering the other objects. I am working with
                    <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/" target="_blank">Prof. Amitabh Varshney</a>
                    and his Ph.D. student

                    During Fall 2019 I was working on a warm-up project about foveated 360º video
                    streaming with a focus on sampling methods to reduce the required bandwidth between
                    server and a client.
